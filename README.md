# Cross-Language Data Pooling in Multilingual Speech Systems

This repository contains an architectural note on cross-language data pooling decisions in multilingual speech systems.
It focuses on when pooling helps, when it hurts, and why, across different speech tasks with concrete, experience-driven examples.

The goal is not to propose a universal rule, but to articulate task-dependent criteria and failure modes that arise when training multilingual STS (speech-to-speech) and TTS systems.
